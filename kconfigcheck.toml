# pmaports CI and "pmbootstrap kconfig check" use this file to ensure our

[aliases]
# Devices with options="pmb:kconfigcheck-community" in the device APKBUILD will
# check for the following categories. A CI check ensures that all devices in
# device/main and device/community dirs have this option. Devices in testing
# may also have "pmb:kconfigcheck-community", but it may be removed when
# modifying the required options and adjusting the devices in testing is too
# much effort. Device maintainers may fix it up afterwards and add it back.

# Implemented value types:
# - tristate (e.g. 'ANDROID_PARANOID_NETWORK = n'):
#   - y: built-in, preferred but module is OK
#   - m: module, preferred but built-in is OK
#   - n: disabled
# - list (e.g. 'ANDROID_BINDER_DEVICES = ["binder", "hwbinder"]'):
#   - each element of the array must be contained in the kernel config string,
#     in any order. The example above would accept the following in the config:
#       CONFIG_ANDROID_BINDER_DEVICES="hwbinder,vndbinder,binder"
# - string (e.g. 'LSM = "lockdown,yama,loadpin,safesetid,integrity"'):
#   - the value in the kernel config must be the same as the given string. Use
#     this e.g. if the order of the elements is important.

# default: all devices must satisfy these
